Methane
Methane is a web-based platform that encourages people to recycle more by smoothing over the process of communication between Recyclers and Collectors. This is an effort to increase the number of individuals who sign up to be Recyclers and/or Collectors.
Collection points will be distributed across various geographical locations. Recyclers will choose their preferred  location, set an appointment, and describe the kind of items they will be submitting. Collectors will then confirm the submission when the recycler hands-over the items.
